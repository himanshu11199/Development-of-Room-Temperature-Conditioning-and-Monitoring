# Development-of-Room-Temperature-Conditioning-and-Monitoring
Develop a Simulation modal on MATLAB and also create a L35 Circuit on Arduino after that Interface Arduino with Matlab just because it helps to Find the Temprature and its proper Simulation graph on MATLAB, which shows the how much temperture has increased and decreased. This project, I have make because we knon that in India weather condition are change periodically, so there is no fix weather condition and also various state have many different temperature and humidity. In various task we can need constant weather condition but it is not possible for weather but it is possible to maintain condition of a specific system.  So for various purpose like food preserving, mushroom farming, room conditioning we can control the various aspects like temperature and humidity. So by the help of sensors we can control specific system temperature and humidit
